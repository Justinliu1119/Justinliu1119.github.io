    -  Led a team of three to design, implement, and simulate Time Difference of Arrival and Kalman Filtering Algorithms to compute the precise location of the submarine and predict its future projectile in scenarios involving loss of communication.
    - Implemented the Kalman Filtering model to optimize trajectory predictions, reduce noise impact, and improve localization accuracy
    - Developed a probabilistic search model for offline submersibles, employing Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to define initial search areas and patterns based on Kalman-filtered predictions

    I coordinated a team of three to design and implement an innovative embedded fridge management system. This project featured both local and remote iOS app UIs, enabling users to record details such as expiration dates and storage locations and manage their fridge contents from either interface.

    **Hardware**: Established communication protocols (SPI, UART, I2C, and parallel) between devices such as a temperature sensor, keypad, and barcode scanner, all integrated with an Atmega328p microcontroller.

    **Software**: Developed an application for real-time synchronization of grocery items via an information query mechanism implemented in a JSON-like format using Firebase. This included: 1)Entering and transmitting item information on either UI through a Raspberry Pi. 2)Monitoring the fridge's internal temperature. 3)Sending notifications for high temperatures and items nearing expiration.

    - Measured and Displayed Speed: Calculated object speed (cm/sec) using LED light sources and phototransistors, displaying results on an LCD and dial-type speedometer.
    - User Interaction and Alerts: Allowed speed threshold setting via a knob, indicated measurement progress with an LED, and triggered an alarm tone with a buzzer for threshold breaches.
    - Communication and Comparison: Enabled RS-232 serial communication to display and compare local and remote speed measurements, with comparison indicated by two LEDs.    
  
 
- pjTitle: "Electric Guitar via Band-Pass Filter"

    - Created a bandpass filter targeting the guitar G chord (~196Hz), converting the magnetic field from plucked strings into signals, which are then filtered and amplified through an RC circuit and a noninverting amplifier.
    - Implemented a noninverting amplifier with a 10kÎ© feedback resistor to amplify the pickup signal by a factor of 11.
    - Successfully converted signals into magnetic fields, producing amplified acoustic sound via a speaker, with the bandpass filter efficiently selecting and outputting signals within the target frequency range.
