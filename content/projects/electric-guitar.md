I designed a band pass filter that filters specifically the guitar G chord which is around 196Hz. The circuit functions as a device to filter the frequencies that were converted by the pickup for the guitar. The guitar filter detects the magnetic field when one plucks the strings, it then converts the magnetic field to signals that go into the RC bandpass circuit, the circuit then amplifies the signal and feeds it into the speaker.

We chose the resistors for R1 and R2 to be 1 kilo-ohms and C1 was chosen to have a capacitance of 1 microFarad and C2 was 680 nanoFarad. Next, we added a noninverting amplifier to our circuit amplifying the signal input of the pickup by a scale of 11 by using the feedback resistor of 10k ohms where R1 was chosen to be 1 kilo-ohm.

This project demonstrates the conversion of a signal into a magnetic field, which in turn produced amplified acoustic sound via the speaker. The bandpass filter we designed efficiently selected and outputted the signal within the intended frequency range.

The output signal shown above matched our expected result. The signal clearly shows a frequency of 196-â€“196+ being selected to be the output.

Our experiment showcased the conversion of a signal into a magnetic field, which in turn produced amplified acoustic sound via the speaker. The bandpass filter we designed efficiently selected and outputted the signal within the intended frequency range. Furthermore, we successfully applied op-amp analysis concepts learned in class to amplify the input signal originating from the pickup.
