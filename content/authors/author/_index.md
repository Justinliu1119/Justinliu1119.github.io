I am an undergraduate senior at the University of Southern California, pursuing dual degrees in Electrical Engineering and Applied and Computational Mathematics. My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Online Linear Programming, and Inference, where I’m passionate about developing new approaches to optimization and predictive modeling. I’ve been fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yinyu Ye from Stanford University and Prof. Peter Beerel from USC, whose mentorship has profoundly shaped my academic and research journey.
