May 2024 - Present,  Palo Alto, CA

Research Assistant (remote) | Advisor: [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/index.html) (Stanford University)
- Co-developed and simulated an adaptive online optimization algorithm using Sampled Average Approximation (SAA) for revealed
parameters and Certainty Equivalent (CE) settings to determine optimal prices and allocations for achieving market equilibrium
- Achieved regret O(log(n)) and constraint violation O(1) using the online adaptive Certainty Equivalent algorithm and Sample
Averaged Approximation, outperforming the static pricing model benchmarked against the offline oracle
- Achieved convergence in a revealed parameter setting via Sample Average Approximation(SAA); implemented a decoupling
method to balance the SAA parameters and the CE learned dual prices for faster convergence and robust decision-making

Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. [Peter Beerel](https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/people/)
- Distributed Inference & Malicious Device Detection
  - Proposed and developed a dynamic pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) with a tunable period to mitigate the risk of
unsuccessful detection by preventing attackers from exploiting PRNG periodicity
  - Validated the optimized detection probability for stochastic attacks on single and multiple devices that guarantees 99%
confidence intervals with minimal redundant overhead
