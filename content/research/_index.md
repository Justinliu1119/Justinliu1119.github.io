#### 📝  Arrow-Debreu Equilibrium: Adaptive Online Stochastic Optimization 
May 2024 - Present,  Stanford University

Research Assistant (remote) | Advisor: [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/index.html) 
- Co-developed and simulated an adaptive online optimization algorithm using Sampled Average Approximation (SAA) for revealed
parameters and Certainty Equivalent (CE) settings to determine optimal prices and allocations for achieving market equilibrium
- Achieved regret 𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛)) and constraint violation 𝑂(1) using the online adaptive Certainty Equivalent algorithm and Sample
Averaged Approximation, outperforming the static pricing model benchmarked against the offline oracle
- Achieved convergence in a revealed parameter setting via Sampled Average Approximation(SAA); implemented a decoupling
method to balance the SAA parameters and the CE learned dual prices for faster convergence and robust decision-making

#### 📝  Distributed Inference & Malicious Device Detection
Aug. 2024 - Present,  University of Southern California

Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. [Peter Beerel](https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/people/)
  - Proposed and developed a dynamic pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) with a tunable period to mitigate the risk of
unsuccessful detection by preventing attackers from exploiting PRNG periodicity
  - Validated the optimized detection probability for stochastic attacks on single and multiple devices that guarantees 99%
confidence intervals with minimal redundant overhead
  - Substantiated the number of inferences required for detection converges to an upper bound with low redundancy overhead,
showing the gap between independent and centralized RNG methods remains minimal across varying redundancy ratios

#### 📝  Optimized Computing for Training Object Detection Models
Aug. 2023 - Apr. 2024,  University of Southern California

Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. [Peter Beerel](https://sites.usc.edu/eessc/people/)
  - Developed an algorithm to create Rolling Shutter (RS) effects by amalgamating successive rows from sequences of high frame
rate Global Shutter (GS) images, which were generated using Unreal Engine 5
  - Assisted in training and object detection models (YOLOv8 & DETR): enhanced pedestrian detection accuracy by utilizing
real and synthetic, achieving comparable performance under RS and GS conditions without requiring RS correction
  - Validated the proposed pipeline on the corresponding real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial improvementsin precision
(13.1%), recall (53.1%), and mean Average Precision (30.3%)


#### 📝  Design Automation of Intelligent Systems Lab, 
July 2024 - Present,  Northwestern University

Research Assistant(remote) | Advisor: Prof. Qi Zhu
- Explored Markov Decision Processes with augmented state spaces to handle time delays, analyzing their impact on maintaining the
Markovian property and improving reinforcement learning efficiency in delayed environments
- Trained Advantage Weighted Actor-Critic (AWAC), enabling policy learning from offline datasets with online fine-tuning.
- Implemented reward inference with variational-delay via Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL), Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), and Behavior Cloning (BC) to infer reward functions from expert demonstrations.

Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. Mercedeh Khajavikhan. 

- Coupled laser beam into an optical fiber and designed precise housing for fiber-transducer alignment, utilizing techniques in Gaussian beam propagation(beam waist optimization and mode matching) which has contributed to:

  - Efficient light propagation through the acousto-optic system, enhancing the interaction between optical and acoustic.
  
  - Tunable lensing power range with an inverse focal length variation from 1.88 1/m to 2.55 1/m, based on duty cycle adjustments.

- Built a temperature detector with an Arduino-embedded drone to detect real-time temperature within the water tank through which the laser beam penetrates

May 2023-Aug. 2023， Tsinghua University Department of Electronic

Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. Hongwei Chen & Dr. Chengyang Hu. 

- Assisted in implementing a spatial-adaptive CNN architecture that significantly improved imaging quality by effectively mitigating
optical aberrations through the precise removal of Point Spread Functions (PSFs)
- Simulated a raytracing and superposition algorithm to create PSF-convoluted images, simulating real-world optical aberrations
- Enhanced a spatial-adaptive CNN by using PSF-convoluted synthetic data, improving correction of spatially variant blur and
