description = """
- Co-developed and simulated an adaptive online optimization algorithm under revealed parameters, and known distribution settings respectively to determine equilibrium-optimal prices and allocations for the Arrow-Debreu Market
- Improved regret  and constraint violation  respectively with both the online adaptive certainty equivalent algorithm, and Sample Averaged Approximation, outperforming the static pricing model benchmarked against the offline oracle
- Empirically and analytically proved the price convergence in the revealed parameter setting with Sampled Averaged Approximation

- Developed an algorithm to create Rolling Shutter (RS) effects by amalgamating successive rows from sequences of high frame rate Global Shutter (GS) images, which were generated using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)
- Trained & fine-tuned object detection models (YOLOv8 & DETR) on the synthetic datasets using a mix of real and synthetic data
- Validated the proposed pipeline on the corresponding real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in precision (13.1%), recall (53.1%), and mean Average Precision (30.3%)
- Demonstrated that ISP-less CV pipelines could achieve comparable performance to traditional ISP CV pipelines at a lower hardware cost when fine-tuned with real datasets

- Assisted to implement a spatial-adaptive CNN architecture that significantly improved imaging quality by effectively mitigating optical aberrations through the precise removal of Point Spread Functions (PSFs).
- Simulated a raytracing and superposition algorithm to create PSF-convoluted images, simulating real-world optical aberrations for generating synthetic data to train a CNN, enhancing image restoration.
- Enhanced a spatial-adaptive CNN by using PSF-convoluted synthetic data, significantly improving correction of spatially variant blur and chromatic dispersion; This approach reduced artificial textures, preserved image details, and lowered computational overhead, achieving a 1.7% improvement in restoration over state-of-the-art methods.
